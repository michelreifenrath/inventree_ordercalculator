# Documentation Compliance Report

This report summarizes the findings of a review of project documentation files against the criteria outlined in [`docs/documentation_compliance_checklist.md`](docs/documentation_compliance_checklist.md:1).

## 1. [`README.md`](README.md:1)

### Findings:

*   **1. Minimum Viable Documentation:**
    *   The [`README.md`](README.md:1) is generally concise and useful, providing essential information for installation, configuration, and usage.
    *   It appears to cut out unnecessary information effectively.
    *   It seems well-maintained and trimmed.
*   **2. Update Docs with Code:**
    *   Based on a static review, the documentation appears to align with the features described (e.g., `uv` usage, Docker support, filtering options). A dynamic check against the codebase would be needed for full verification.
*   **3. Delete Dead Documentation:**
    *   No sections appear to be obviously dead, outdated, or incorrect.
*   **4. Prefer the Good Over the Perfect:**
    *   The [`README.md`](README.md:1) is a good and useful document.
*   **5. Documentation is the Story of Your Code:**
    *   The document tells a clear story for new users, guiding them through setup and basic operation.
    *   **5.4. [`README.md`](README.md:1) Specifics:**
        *   **Orients new users:** Yes, effectively.
        *   **Points to more detailed explanations/guides:** It points to configuration files like [`.env.example`](.env.example:0), [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml:0), and [`uv.lock`](uv.lock:0). It could potentially link to [`Specification.md`](Specification.md:1) for design details or a general `docs/` overview if one existed.
        *   **Clearly states directory purpose:** Yes, "A command-line tool to calculate the required components...".
        *   **Indicates first files for developers / API files:** Implicitly, configuration files and main usage commands are highlighted.
        *   **States maintainers / more info:** This information is currently missing.
*   **6. Duplication is Evil:**
    *   No obvious problematic duplication of information was found. Installation and configuration instructions are specific to this project.
*   **Overall Comments & Recommendations:**
    *   The [`README.md`](README.md:1) is well-structured and informative.
    *   **Recommendation:** Add a section for "Maintainers" or "Getting Help" to fulfill checklist item 5.4.
    *   **Consideration:** Link to [`Specification.md`](Specification.md:1) or other key documents in [`docs/`](docs/:0) if deeper understanding is beneficial for users/developers from the outset.

## 2. [`Specification.md`](Specification.md:1)

### Findings:

*   **1. Minimum Viable Documentation:**
    *   The document is detailed, which is appropriate for a specification. It is useful for understanding the tool's intended design and functionality.
*   **2. Update Docs with Code:**
    *   The specification seems to align with the features described in the [`README.md`](README.md:1) (e.g., core logic, filtering). A thorough check against the current codebase would be needed to confirm full alignment.
*   **3. Delete Dead Documentation:**
    *   No sections appear obviously outdated or irrelevant.
*   **4. Prefer the Good Over the Perfect:**
    *   The document is good and serves its purpose as a specification well.
*   **5. Documentation is the Story of Your Code:**
    *   It clearly tells the story of the tool's design, scope, inputs, outputs, and core logic.
    *   **5.6. Design Docs, PRDs:**
        *   **Serves as archive of design decisions:** Yes, this document effectively archives the initial design decisions, scope, and acceptance criteria for the project.
*   **6. Duplication is Evil:**
    *   No obvious problematic duplication. It details aspects that are only summarized elsewhere (e.g., in [`README.md`](README.md:1)).
*   **Overall Comments & Recommendations:**
    *   A solid specification document.
    *   Ensure it is reviewed and updated if the core logic or scope of the application changes significantly.

## 3. [`docs/google_styleguide_best_practices.md`](docs/google_styleguide_best_practices.md:1)

### Findings:

*   **1. Minimum Viable Documentation:**
    *   As a copy of an external style guide, it is useful as a reference document. Its length is inherent to the source.
*   **2. Update Docs with Code:**
    *   Not applicable, as this is a static copy of an external guide.
*   **3. Delete Dead Documentation:**
    *   Not applicable. Its relevance depends on the team's decision to adhere to this specific style guide.
*   **4. Prefer the Good Over the Perfect:**
    *   It's a "good" reference.
*   **5. Documentation is the Story of Your Code:**
    *   This file itself is a meta-document about documentation.
    *   **5.5. `docs/` Directory (General Context):**
        *   The [`docs/`](docs/:0) directory, as a whole, currently lacks specific guides for this project on:
            *   How to get started (beyond the [`README.md`](README.md:1)).
            *   How to run project tests.
            *   How to debug the project's output.
            *   How to release the binary/software.
        *   This file ([`docs/google_styleguide_best_practices.md`](docs/google_styleguide_best_practices.md:1)) serves as a resource within the [`docs/`](docs/:0) directory but doesn't fulfill those project-specific documentation needs.
*   **6. Duplication is Evil:**
    *   This file is a duplication of an external guide. The checklist notes: "Avoid writing custom guides for common technologies or processes if an official or existing guide is available; link to it instead." However, having a local copy for reference can be acceptable, especially if it's a foundational document for the team. The file does link to the original source.
*   **Overall Comments & Recommendations:**
    *   Useful as a reference if the team intends to follow these specific best practices.
    *   **Recommendation:** The [`docs/`](docs/:0) directory should be expanded with project-specific documentation covering testing, debugging, and release processes as per checklist item 5.5.

## 4. [`docs/architecture/presets_feature_architecture.md`](docs/architecture/presets_feature_architecture.md:1)

### Findings:

*   **1. Minimum Viable Documentation:**
    *   The document is detailed, which is appropriate for an architecture design document. It is useful for understanding the design of the "Save/Load Presets" feature.
*   **2. Update Docs with Code:**
    *   This document outlines a proposed architecture. If the feature has been implemented, this document should be reviewed to ensure it accurately reflects the implemented design or is marked as a historical design document. (Static check limitation).
*   **3. Delete Dead Documentation:**
    *   No obvious signs of being dead, assuming the "Presets" feature is current or planned.
*   **4. Prefer the Good Over the Perfect:**
    *   The document is good and serves its architectural design purpose well.
*   **5. Documentation is the Story of Your Code:**
    *   It clearly tells the story of the intended architecture for the presets feature.
    *   **5.5. `docs/` Directory (General Context):** (Same as findings for [`docs/google_styleguide_best_practices.md`](docs/google_styleguide_best_practices.md:1) regarding missing project-specific guides).
    *   **5.6. Design Docs, PRDs:**
        *   **Serves as archive of design decisions:** Yes, this document effectively archives the design decisions for the presets feature.
*   **6. Duplication is Evil:**
    *   No obvious problematic duplication.
*   **Overall Comments & Recommendations:**
    *   A good architecture document for the specific feature.
    *   **Recommendation:** If the feature is implemented, verify this document against the implementation and update or mark as historical as needed.

## 5. `research/` Directory Files

The files within the [`research/`](research/:0) directory document a specific research process (TDD for Streamlit Applications). They primarily serve as an archive of that research.

### General Assessment for `research/` files:

*   **1. Minimum Viable Documentation:** Each file is generally short, focused on a specific stage of the research (e.g., scope, key questions, findings, synthesis). Collectively, they are useful as an archive of the research process. They appear to be trimmed to their specific purpose.
*   **2. Update Docs with Code:** Not directly applicable, as these are research notes, not documentation of the project's codebase itself.
*   **3. Delete Dead Documentation:** The relevance depends on whether the research topic is still active or if its conclusions have been integrated. For an archived research process, they are not "dead" in the traditional sense.
*   **4. Prefer the Good Over the Perfect:** The documents are "good" for the purpose of recording a research process.
*   **5. Documentation is the Story of Your Code (or in this case, Research):**
    *   Collectively, these files tell the story of the research undertaken, from initial questions to final recommendations.
    *   **5.6. Design Docs, PRDs (Applied to Research Process):** These documents serve as an archive of the research methodology, data collection, analysis, and decisions made during the research.
*   **6. Duplication is Evil:**
    *   There is inherent summarization and synthesis in the later stages of the research (e.g., `04_synthesis/` and `05_final_report/` draw from earlier findings). This is a natural part of a research reporting structure and not considered "evil" duplication in this context. The final report aims to be a standalone summary.
*   **Specific File Notes (Highlights):**
    *   [`research/01_initial_queries/01_scope_definition.md`](research/01_initial_queries/01_scope_definition.md:1): Clearly defines scope. Concise.
    *   [`research/01_initial_queries/02_key_questions.md`](research/01_initial_queries/02_key_questions.md:1): Clear, focused questions.
    *   [`research/01_initial_queries/03_information_sources.md`](research/01_initial_queries/03_information_sources.md:1): Useful list for the research process.
    *   [`research/02_data_collection/01_primary_findings.md`](research/02_data_collection/01_primary_findings.md:1) & [`research/02_data_collection/02_secondary_findings.md`](research/02_data_collection/02_secondary_findings.md:1): Document findings clearly. Code examples in secondary findings are valuable.
    *   [`research/03_analysis/01_patterns_identified.md`](research/03_analysis/01_patterns_identified.md:1), [`research/03_analysis/02_contradictions.md`](research/03_analysis/02_contradictions.md:1), [`research/03_analysis/03_knowledge_gaps.md`](research/03_analysis/03_knowledge_gaps.md:1): Show a structured analysis process.
    *   [`research/04_synthesis/01_integrated_model.md`](research/04_synthesis/01_integrated_model.md:1), [`research/04_synthesis/02_key_insights.md`](research/04_synthesis/02_key_insights.md:1), [`research/04_synthesis/03_practical_applications.md`](research/04_synthesis/03_practical_applications.md:1): Good synthesis of the research into actionable information.
    *   [`research/05_final_report/`](research/05_final_report/:0) (all files): Form a comprehensive final report based on the preceding research stages. The structure is logical. [`research/05_final_report/00_table_of_contents.md`](research/05_final_report/00_table_of_contents.md:1) is useful.

*   **Overall Comments & Recommendations for `research/`:**
    *   The `research/` directory provides a good example of documenting a research process.
    *   These files are valuable as an archive. No specific non-compliance issues noted against their purpose.
    *   The checklist items related to `README.md` specifics or `docs/` directory contents (getting started, tests, debug, release for *the project*) are not applicable to these individual research files.

## Summary of Key Recommendations:

1.  **[`README.md`](README.md:1):** Add a "Maintainers" or "Getting Help" section. Consider linking to other key design documents.
2.  **`docs/` Directory:** Create project-specific documentation covering:
    *   How to run tests.
    *   How to debug the project.
    *   How to release the software.
    *   A more detailed "Getting Started" guide if the [`README.md`](README.md:1) isn't sufficient for developers.
3.  **Architecture/Design Documents:** Ensure that documents like [`docs/architecture/presets_feature_architecture.md`](docs/architecture/presets_feature_architecture.md:1) are reviewed and updated to reflect the current state of implemented features, or are clearly marked as historical.
