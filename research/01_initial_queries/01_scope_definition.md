# Scope Definition: TDD for Streamlit Applications

This research focuses on identifying and evaluating best practices, tools, and techniques for applying Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles specifically to applications built with the Streamlit framework.

**In Scope:**

*   Testing strategies for Streamlit's reactive script execution model.
*   Methods for testing UI components (widgets, forms, data display elements).
*   Techniques for mocking backend services and dependencies (e.g., APIs, databases, calculation logic) within Streamlit tests.
*   Identification and evaluation of Python testing libraries, frameworks, and plugins suitable for Streamlit (e.g., `pytest`, `unittest`, Streamlit-specific testing tools).
*   Distinguishing between and applying unit, integration, and end-to-end (E2E) testing approaches in a Streamlit context.
*   Strategies for managing, manipulating, and asserting Streamlit's session state (`st.session_state`) during tests.
*   Providing practical code examples for common testing scenarios.
*   Analyzing the pros and cons of different testing approaches and tools.

**Out of Scope:**

*   General Python TDD practices not specific to Streamlit's challenges.
*   Performance testing of Streamlit applications.
*   Security testing of Streamlit applications.
*   Deployment strategies for tested Streamlit applications.
*   Detailed tutorials on basic `pytest` or `unittest` usage (focus is on Streamlit integration).
