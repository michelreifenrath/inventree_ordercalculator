# Primary Findings: Testing Streamlit Applications

Based on initial research using Perplexity AI (Search Results [1-5]), here are the primary findings regarding best practices and tools for testing Streamlit applications:

---

### **Core Testing Frameworks & Tools**

*   **Streamlit's Native `AppTest`:**
    *   Streamlit provides a built-in testing API (`streamlit.testing.v1.AppTest`) designed specifically for its reactive model [3, 5].
    *   It allows simulating user interactions (widget clicks, input changes) and app execution programmatically, without needing a browser [3].
    *   Key capabilities include managing session state, handling script reruns implicitly, testing components in isolation (`AppTest.from_file`), and supporting multipage apps [3, 5].
*   **`pytest` Integration:**
    *   `pytest` is the recommended test runner for organizing and executing Streamlit tests [1, 3].
    *   Leverage `pytest` features like fixtures for setup/teardown and plugins like `pytest-mock` for mocking and `pytest-cov` for coverage [1, 3, General Knowledge].

### **Testing Strategies & Structure**

*   **Component-Level Testing:**
    *   Isolate individual UI components or small sections of the app using `AppTest.from_file("path/to/component.py")` [5].
    *   Test the component's rendering and behavior based on simulated inputs or state changes [5].
    *   Example: Verify a title component displays the correct text [5].
*   **Full App / Integration Testing:**
    *   Use `AppTest.from_file("main_app.py")` to load the entire application script [5].
    *   Simulate user journeys involving multiple interactions, widget changes, and navigation (if applicable) [3, 5].
    *   Assert the final state of the UI or session state after a sequence of actions.
*   **Unit Testing:**
    *   Pure Python helper functions (those not directly using `st.` calls) can be tested using standard Python unit testing techniques (`pytest`, `unittest`) without `AppTest`.

### **Handling Streamlit's Reactivity**

*   `AppTest` is designed to handle the script rerun mechanism automatically [3]. When you simulate an interaction (e.g., `app.button("Click Me").click()`), `AppTest` simulates the rerun and updates the app state accordingly.
*   Tests should focus on asserting the *state* of the application (widget values, displayed text, `session_state`) *after* interactions, rather than the exact flow of execution during reruns.

---

### **Mocking Dependencies**

*   Standard Python mocking libraries like `unittest.mock` or `pytest-mock` are used [General Knowledge, Implied by 3].
*   Mock external services (APIs, databases) called within Streamlit functions or helper functions.
*   Streamlit's secrets management can be tested by mocking `st.secrets` if necessary [3].
*   Mocks can sometimes be passed into the `AppTest.run()` method, potentially via fixtures or direct parameterization depending on test structure [Implied by 3, 5].

### **Testing UI Components & State**

*   **Widgets:** Interact with widgets using `AppTest` methods (e.g., `app.button("label").click()`, `app.text_input("label").input("value")`, `app.selectbox("label").select("option")`) [3, 5].
*   **Assertions:** Assert the state or value of widgets directly (e.g., `assert app.title[0].value == "Expected Title"`) or check elements rendered via `st.write`, `st.table`, etc. by inspecting the `AppTest` object's elements (e.g., `app.markdown`, `app.table`) [5, 3].
*   **Session State:** `AppTest` inherently manages `st.session_state`. You can assert its contents after interactions: `assert app.session_state.my_variable == expected_value`.

---

### **Continuous Integration (CI)**

*   Automate test execution using CI platforms like GitHub Actions [3].
*   Run `pytest` commands within the CI workflow to ensure tests pass before merging or deploying [3].

---

### **Key Recommendations & Pitfalls**

*   **Prefer `AppTest`:** Use Streamlit's native testing framework over general-purpose browser automation tools (like Selenium) for unit/integration tests, as it's more efficient and tailored [2, 3].
*   **Structure Tests:** Separate component tests from full app tests for clarity and maintainability [5].
*   **Focus on State:** Assert the resulting UI/state, not the intermediate steps during reruns.
