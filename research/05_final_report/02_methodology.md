# Methodology

This research employed a structured, recursive approach to investigate best practices and tools for applying Test-Driven Development (TDD) to Streamlit applications. The process involved leveraging Perplexity AI for information gathering and organizing findings into a hierarchical documentation system within the `research/` directory.

The methodology followed these phases:

1.  **Phase 1: Initial Queries & Scoping:**
    *   Defined the research scope, explicitly outlining what aspects of Streamlit TDD were in and out of scope ([`research/01_initial_queries/01_scope_definition.md`](research/01_initial_queries/01_scope_definition.md)).
    *   Formulated key research questions targeting specific challenges like testing reactivity, UI components, mocking, tooling, and state management ([`research/01_initial_queries/02_key_questions.md`](research/01_initial_queries/02_key_questions.md)).
    *   Identified potential information sources, including official documentation, community forums, blogs, and relevant libraries ([`research/01_initial_queries/03_information_sources.md`](research/01_initial_queries/03_information_sources.md)).

2.  **Phase 2: Data Collection:**
    *   Utilized the Perplexity AI MCP tool (`search` capability) to perform targeted searches based on the key questions.
    *   An initial broad search gathered general practices and identified Streamlit's native `AppTest` framework. Findings were documented in [`research/02_data_collection/01_primary_findings.md`](research/02_data_collection/01_primary_findings.md).
    *   A subsequent, more specific search focused on obtaining concrete code examples for testing forms, data display, session state, and mocking using `AppTest`. These were documented in [`research/02_data_collection/02_secondary_findings.md`](research/02_data_collection/02_secondary_findings.md).

3.  **Phase 3: Analysis:**
    *   Reviewed the collected primary and secondary findings to identify recurring themes and recommended approaches ([`research/03_analysis/01_patterns_identified.md`](research/03_analysis/01_patterns_identified.md)).
    *   Checked for any conflicting information or contradictory advice across sources ([`research/03_analysis/02_contradictions.md`](research/03_analysis/02_contradictions.md)).
    *   Documented areas where information was lacking or specific scenarios weren't covered in detail ([`research/03_analysis/03_knowledge_gaps.md`](research/03_analysis/03_knowledge_gaps.md)).

4.  **Phase 4: Synthesis:**
    *   Integrated the analyzed findings into a cohesive model outlining the recommended layered testing strategy ([`research/04_synthesis/01_integrated_model.md`](research/04_synthesis/01_integrated_model.md)).
    *   Extracted the most critical takeaways and insights ([`research/04_synthesis/02_key_insights.md`](research/04_synthesis/02_key_insights.md)).
    *   Translated the insights into actionable steps and practical applications for developers ([`research/04_synthesis/03_practical_applications.md`](research/04_synthesis/03_practical_applications.md)).

5.  **Phase 5: Final Report Generation:**
    *   Compiled the synthesized information into this structured final report, organizing the content according to the predefined sections (Executive Summary, Methodology, Findings, Analysis, Recommendations, References).

This iterative process allowed for refinement of search queries based on initial findings and ensured a comprehensive analysis grounded in the collected data.
