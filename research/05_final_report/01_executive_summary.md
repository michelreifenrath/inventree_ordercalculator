# Executive Summary: TDD for Streamlit Applications

This report details best practices and tools for applying Test-Driven Development (TDD) to Streamlit applications. Streamlit's reactive, top-to-bottom script execution model presents unique testing challenges compared to traditional web frameworks.

The research concludes that **effective TDD for Streamlit is achievable using a combination of Streamlit's native testing framework, `streamlit.testing.v1.AppTest`, and the standard Python test runner, `pytest`**.

**Key Findings & Recommendations:**

1.  **`AppTest` is Essential:** Use `AppTest` for testing the Streamlit UI layer. It simulates the runtime, user interactions (widget clicks, inputs), and state management (`st.session_state`) programmatically without requiring a browser, efficiently handling the framework's reactivity.
2.  **Layered Testing Strategy:**
    *   **Unit Test** backend logic (pure Python functions/classes) using standard `pytest`.
    *   **Integration Test** the Streamlit UI (`app.py` or components) using `AppTest` + `pytest`, mocking backend dependencies.
3.  **Focus on State:** `AppTest` tests should assert the final state of UI elements and `st.session_state` after interactions, rather than tracking the exact execution flow during implicit reruns.
4.  **Standard Mocking:** Use `unittest.mock` or `pytest-mock` to isolate the Streamlit app from external services (APIs, databases) during integration tests.
5.  **`pytest` for Structure:** Leverage `pytest` for test organization, fixtures, and plugins (e.g., `pytest-mock`, `pytest-cov`).
6.  **Refactor for Testability:** Extract complex logic from Streamlit scripts into testable Python functions/classes.

**Conclusion:** By adopting `AppTest` for UI integration testing and standard Python practices for unit testing backend logic, developers can implement a robust TDD workflow for Streamlit, leading to more reliable and maintainable applications. While core functionality is well-covered, testing highly complex or custom components may require further exploration.
